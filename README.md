# ML-Project
This Project was done by 2 students as a group for the course Applied Machine Learning using Python.
Through this project we have learned how to clean and pre process, understand and analyze data.
We have applied various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms on 2 different data sets and learned which algorithm suits our data best and provides good analysis with optimal error.
